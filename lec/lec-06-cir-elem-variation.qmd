# Circuit Element Variations



* All electronic components have manufacturing tolerances\.
  * Resistors can be purchased with  10%\,  5%\, and   1% tolerance\.  \(IC resistors are often  10%\.\)
  * Capacitors can have asymmetrical tolerances such as \+20%/\-50%\.
  * Power supply voltages typically vary from 1% to 10%\.
* Device parameters will also vary with temperature and age\.
* Circuits must be designed to accommodate these variations\.
* We will use worst\-case and Monte Carlo \(statistical\) analysis to examine the effects of component parameter variations\.


# Tolerance Modeling

For symmetrical parameter variations

Pnom\(1 \- \)  P  Pnom\(1 \+ \)

For example\, a 10 k resistor with 5% percent tolerance could take on the following range of values:

10k\(1 \- 0\.05\)  R  10k\(1 \+ 0\.05\)

9500   R  10500 

# Circuit Analysis with Tolerances



* Worst\-case analysis
  * Parameters are manipulated to produce the worst\-case min and max values of desired quantities\.
  * This can lead to over design since the worst\-case combination of parameters is rare\.
  * It may be less expensive to discard a rare failure than to design for 100% yield\.
* Monte\-Carlo analysis
  * Parameters are randomly varied to generate a set of statistics for desired outputs\.
  * The design can be optimized so that failures due to parameter variation are less frequent than failures due to other mechanisms\.
  * In this way\, the design difficulty is better managed than a worst\-case approach\.


# Worst Case Analysis Example

Problem: Find the nominal and worst\-case values for output voltage and source current\.

Known Information and Given Data: Circuit topology and values in figure\.

Unknowns:

Approach:  Find nominal values and then select R1\, R2\, and VI values to generate extreme cases of the unknowns\.

Nominal Source current:

Rewrite VO to help us determine how to find the worst\-case values\.

VO is maximized for max VI\, R1 and min R2\.

VO is minimized for min VI\, R1\, and max R2\.

Worst\-case source currents:

Check of Results:  The worst\-case values range from 14\-17 percent above and below the nominal values\.  The sum of the three element tolerances is 20 percent\, so our calculated values appear to be reasonable\.

# Monte Carlo Analysis

Parameters are varied randomly and output statistics are gathered\.

We use programs like MATLAB\, Python\, SPICE\, or a spreadsheet to complete a statistically significant set of calculations\.

For example\, with Excel\, a resistor with a nominal value Rnom and tolerance  can be expressed as:

The RAND\(\) function returns random numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 1\.

Circuit equations based on Monte Carlo parameters:

Avg	Nom\.	Stdev	Max	WC\-max	Min	WC\-Min

Vo \(V\)	4\.96	5\.00	0\.30	5\.70	5\.87	4\.37	4\.20

II \(mA\)	0\.276	0\.278	0\.0173	0\.310	 0\.322	0\.242	0\.238

P \(mW\)	4\.12	4\.17	0\.490	5\.04	\-\-	3\.29	\-\-

# Temperature Coefficients

Most circuit parameters are temperature sensitive\.

P = Pnom\(1\+1∆T\+ 2∆T2\) where ∆T = T\-Tnom

Pnom is defined at Tnom

Most versions of SPICE allow for the specification of TNOM\, T\, TC1\(1\)\, TC2\(2\)\.

SPICE temperature model for resistor:

R\(T\) = R\(TNOM\)\*\[1\+TC1\*\(T\-TNOM\)\+TC2\*\(T\-TNOM\)2\]

Many other components have similar models\.

# Numeric Precision

Most circuit parameters vary from less than  1 % to greater than  50%\.

As a consequence\, more than three significant digits is meaningless\.

Results in the text will be represented with three significant digits:  2\.03 mA\, 5\.72 V\, 0\.0436 µA\, and so on\.

However\, extra guard digits are normally retained during calculations\.

# Tolerances & Worst-Case Analysis Example

__Problem:__  Find worst\-case values of  _I_  _C_  and  _V_  _CE_  in the circuit below\.

__Given data: __ b _FO_  __ __ = 75 with 50% tolerance\,  _V_  _A _ = 50 V\, 5 % tolerance on  _V_  _CC _ \, 10% tolerance for each resistor\.  R1 = 18 kW\, R2 = 36 kW\.

__Simplified Analysis:__

To maximize IC \, VEQ should be maximized\, RE should be minimized and the opposite for minimizing IC\.  Extremes of RE are: 14\.4 kW and  17\.6 kW\.

![](img/lec-06-cir-elem-variation_5.jpg)

To maximize VEQ\, VCC and R1 should be maximized\, R2 should be minimized and opposite for minimizing VEQ\.

# Tolerances & Worst-Case Analysis Example (cont.)

![](img/lec-06-cir-elem-variation_6.jpg)

Extremes of VEQ are: 4\.78 V and 3\.31 V\.

Extremes for  IC are: 283 mA and 148 mA\.

To maximize VCE \, IC and RC should be minimized\, and opposite for minimizing VEQ\.

Extremes of VCE are: 7\.06 V \(forward\-active region\) and

0\.471 V \(saturated\, hence calculated values for

VCE and IC actually not correct\)\.

# Tolerances - Monte Carlo Analysis

In real circuits\, it is unlikely that various components will reach their extremes at the same time\, instead they will have some statistical distribution\. Hence worst\-case analysis over\-estimates extremes of circuit behavior\.

In Monte Carlo analysis\, values of each circuit parameter are randomly selected from possible distributions of parameters and used to analyze the circuit\.

Random parameter sets are generated\, and the statistical behavior of circuit is built up from the analysis of many test cases\.

# Tolerances - Monte Carlo Analysis Example

For each Case: Assign random values to all circuit elements

Then calculate resulting currents and voltages

Note: Assume constant VBE = 0\.7 for simplicity\.

# Tolerances - Monte Carlo Analysis Example (cont.)



* Full results of Monte Carlo analysis of 500 cases of the 4\-resistor bias circuit yields mean values of 207 mA and 4\.06 V for  _I_  _C_  and  _V_  _CE_  respectively which are close to values originally estimated from nominal circuit elements\. Standard deviations are 19\.6 mA and 0\.64 V respectively\.
* The worst\-case calculations lie well beyond the extremes of the distributions
  * Note that circuit never saturates in the Monte Carlo Analyses
