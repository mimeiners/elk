## Signaltypen

## Konstantes Signal

Ein konstantes Signal für ein elektronisches System korrespondiert nicht mit der mathematischen Definition einer Konstanten.

Versorgungsspannungen und Referenzsignale elektronischer Schaltungen sind immer fehlerbehaftet (statisch und/oder statistisch).

Toleranzen/Fehlergrenzen

## Nominal und Worst Case

Wir definieren *nominal* als das Ausgangssignal, welches wir bei einem spezifizierten Eingangssignal erwarten; E/A-Verhalten.

Worst case high und worst case low definieren Signale, die über und unter dem nominalen Signal liegen.

## Zeitkontinuierliches Signal

## Sprungsignale

Sprung und Impuls sind plötzliche Amplitudenänderungen.

## Sprungfunktionen

## Analog and Digital Signals

After digitization, the continuous analog signal becomes a set of discrete valueAnalog electrical signals are continuous in time - most often voltage or current. (Charge can also be utilized as a signal conveyor.)

## The Data Conversion Problem

-   Real world signals
    -   Continuous time, continuous amplitude
-   Digital abstraction
    -   Discrete time, discrete amplitude
-   Two problems
    -   How to discretize in time and amplitude
        -   A/D conversion (ADC)
    -   How to “un-discretize” in time and amplitude
        -   D/A conversion (DAC)

## Overview

-   We'll first look at these building blocks from a functional, “black box” perspective.
    -   Refine later and look at implementations

## Analog-to-Digital (A/D) Conversion

Analog input voltage vx is converted to an n-bit number.

For a four-bit converter, vx ranging between 0 and VFS yields a digital output code between 0000 and 1111.

The output is an approximation of the input due to the limited resolution of the n-bit output. Error is expressed as:

## Digital-to-Analog (D/A) Conversion

For an n-bit D/A converter, the output voltage is expressed as:

The smallest possible voltage change is known as the least significant bit or LSB.

## Uniform Sampling and Quantization

-   Most common way of performing A/D conversion
    -   Sample signal uniformly in time
    -   Quantize signal uniformly in amplitude
-   Key questions
    -   How much "noise" is added due to amplitude quantization?
    -   How can we reconstruct the signal back into analog form?
    -   How fast do we need to sample?
        -   Must avoid “aliasing”
        -   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing>

## Consequence

The frequencies fsig and N·fs ± fsig (N integer), are indistinguishable in the discrete time domain.

## Sampling Theorem

-   In order to prevent aliasing, we need
-   The sampling rate fs=2·fsig,max is called the *Nyquist rate*
-   Two possibilities
    -   Sample fast enough to cover all spectral components, including "parasitic" ones outside band of interest
    -   Limit fsig,max through filtering

## Ideal (Brick Wall) Anti-Alias Filter (AAF)

## Practical Anti-Alias Filter (AAF)

Need to sample faster than Nyquist rate to get good attenuation=\> *Oversampling*

## How much Oversampling?

Can tradeoff sampling speed against filter order.

In high speed converters, making fs/fsig,max\>10 is usually impossible or too costly.

Means that we need fairly high order filters.

## Classes of Sampling

## The Reconstruction Problem

## Zero-Order Hold Reconstruction

-   The most practical way of reconstructing the continuous time signal is to simply *hold* the discrete time values
    -   Either for full period Ts or a fraction thereof
    -   Other schemes exist, e.g. *partial-order hold*
-   What does this do to the signal spectrum?
-   We'll analyze this in two steps
    -   First look at infinitely narrow reconstruction pulses

## Dirac Pulses

## Spectrum

Spectrum of Dirac signal contains replicas of Vin(f) at integer multiples of the sampling frequency.

## Finite Hold Pulse

Amplitude Envelope

## Example

**Spectrum of Continuous Time Pulse Train** **(Arbitrary Example)**

**ZOH Transfer Function** **("** **Sinc** \_\_ Distortion")\_\_

**ZOH Output,** **Spectrum of Staircase Approximation**

original spectrum

## Reconstruction Filter

-   Also called smoothing filter
-   Same situation as withanti-alias filter
    -   A brick wall filter would be nice
    -   Oversampling helps reduce filter order

## Quantization of an Analog Signal

-   Quantization step D
-   Quantization error has sawtooth shape
    -   Bounded by
-   Ideally
    -   Infinite input range and infinite number of quantization levels
-   In practice
    -   Finite input range and finite number of quantization levels
    -   Output is a digital word (not an analog voltage)

## Conceptual Model of a Quantizer

-   Encoding block determines how quantized levels are mapped into digital codes
-   Note that this model is not meant to represent an actual hardware implementation
    -   Its purpose is to show that quantization and encoding are conceptually separate operations
    -   Changing the encoding of a quantizer has no interesting implications on its function or performance

## Encoding Example for a B-Bit Quantizer

-   Example: B=3
    -   23=8 distinct output codes
    -   Diagram on the left shows "straight-binary encoding"
    -   See e.g. Analog Devices "MT-009: Data Converter Codes" for other encoding schemes
-   Quantization error grows out of bounds beyond code boundaries
-   We define the full scale range (FSR) as the maximum input range that satisfiesImplies that

## Nomenclature

![](../images/lec-02-signals_25.png)

-   **Overloading** - Occurs when an input outside the FSR is applied
-   **Transition level** – Input value at the transition between two codes. By standard convention, the transition level T(k) lies between codes k-1 and k
-   **Code width** – The difference between adjacent transition levels. By standard convention, the code width W(k)=T(k+1)-T(k)
    -   Note that the code width of the first and last code (000 and 111 on previous slide) is undefined
-   **LSB size (or width)** – synonymous with code width D

\[IEEE Standard 1241-2000\]

## Bipolar Mid-Rise Quantizer

## Bipolar Mid-Tread Quantizer

## Unipolar Quantizer

-   Usually define origin where first code and straight line fit intersect
    -   Otherwise, there would be a systematic offset
-   Usable range is reduced by D/2 below zero

## Effect of Quantization Error on Signal

-   Two aspects
    -   How much noise power does quantization add to samples?
    -   How is this noise power distributed in frequency?
-   Quantization error is a deterministic function of the signal
    -   Should be able to answer above questions using a deterministic analysis.
    -   But, unfortunately, such an analysis strongly depends on the chosen signal and can be very complex.
-   Strategy
    -   Build basic intuition using simple deterministic signals.
    -   Next, abandon idea of deterministic representation and revert to a "general" statistical model (to be used with caution).

## Ramp Input

Applying a ramp signal (periodic sawtooth) at the input of the quantizer gives the following time domain waveform for eq

What is the average power of this waveform?

Integrate over one period

## Sine Wave Input

Integration is not straightforward…

## Quantization Error Histogram

Sinusoidal input signal with fsig=101 Hz, sampled at fs=1000 Hz

8-bit quantizer

Distribution is “almost” uniform

Can approximate average power by integrating uniform distribution

## Statistical Model of Quantization Error

-   Assumption: eq(x) has a uniform probability density
-   This approximation holds reasonably well in practice when
    -   Signal spans large number of quantization steps
    -   Signal is "sufficiently active"
    -   Quantizer does not overload

## Ideal DAC

-   Essentially a digitally controlled voltage, current or charge source
    -   Example below is for unipolar DAC
-   Ideal DAC does not introduce quantization error!

## Static Nonidealities

-   Static deviations of transfer characteristics from ideality
    -   Offset
    -   Gain error
    -   Differential Nonlinearity (DNL)
    -   Integral Nonlinearity (INL)
-   Useful references
    -   “The Importance of Data Converter Static Specifications”, Analog Devices MT-010
    -   “Understanding Data Converters”, Texas Instruments Application Report SLAA013, 1995

## Offset and Gain Error

-   Conceptually simple, but lots of (uninteresting) subtleties in how exactly these errors should be defined
    -   Unipolar vs. bipolar, endpoint vs. midpoint specification
    -   Definition in presence of nonlinearities
-   General idea (neglecting staircase nature of transfer functions):

## ADC Offset and Gain Error

-   Definitions based on bottom and top endpoints of transfer characteristic
    -   ½ LSB before first transition and ½ LSB after last transition
    -   Offset is the deviation of bottom endpoint from its ideal location
    -   Gain error is the deviation of top endpoint from its ideal location with offset removed
-   Both quantities are measured in LSB or as percentage of full-scale range

Same idea, except that endpoints are directly defined by analog output values at minimum and maximum digital input

Also note that errors are specified along the vertical axis

## Comments on Offset and Gain Errors

-   Definitions on the previous slides are the ones typically used in industry
    -   IEEE Standard suggest somewhat more sophisticated definitions based on least square curve fitting
        -   Technically more suitable metric when the transfer characteristics are significantly non-uniform or nonlinear
-   Generally, it is non-trivial to build a converter with very good gain/offset specifications
    -   Nevertheless, since gain and offset affect all codes uniformly, these errors tend to be easy to correct
        -   E.g. using a digital pre- or post-processing operation
    -   Also, many applications are insensitive to a certain level of gain and offset errors
        -   E.g. audio signals, communication-type signals, ...
-   More interesting aspect: linearity
    -   DNL and INL
